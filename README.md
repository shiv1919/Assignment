## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **Login:**
    - Endpoint: POST /api/auth/login
- **Body:**
    - json: { "username": "user1", "password": "password123"}
#### There are two roles for login :
- **note:** Avoid creating users manually from the H2 console. Our application encrypts passwords during user creation and decrypts them during authentication. Manually creating users from the H2 console without encryption will result in authentication failures. Always use the application interface or API for user creation to ensure proper encryption.
#### 1.Admin
- **note:** username:admin, password:adminpass is added in database at run time as we dont have register API to create user.
